# **Cuestionario acerca de Red (REBOL)**

## **Language Purpose**

### **General Purpose**
Design to overcome the limitations that were present in REBOL. The implementation choices of Red intend to develop a Full Stack programming language, useful for high level programming and low level programming, due to its two big parts that are the fundamentals of Red programming: Red and Red/System.
### **Specific purpuses**
* Simplicity.
* Compactness.
* Speed.
* Ubiquity
* Portability.
* Flexibility.

## **Pradigm**
**Reactive programming**, independent of language types (OOPS/function-based). But it has a part of Object-Oriented Language too, REBOL tried to innovate on the language paradigm doing a remix of both mentioned.

## **Strengths and weaknesses**
### **Strenghts**
* **Cross-Compilation.** For any platform it supports via command line switch.
* **For programming in high or low context.** Due to its big two parts mentioned in this document.
* **Capable of metaprogramming.**
### **Weaknesses**

* **Not well documented (yet).** Its official site is under construction, so you can not easily find information about red.
* **New syntax.** You cannot think that is easy to compare with other syntax because it is not.
* **Hard to familiarize at the beginning.** It is not a language to start learning programming, because you need to know previous concepts abouts computing science to understand Red at all.

## **Implementation**
It is a hybrid implementation, because you got the part of high programming and an interpreted by REBOL (interpreted). But you can work with the low-level implementation generating a binary filed after the compiled file (compiled).

## **Runtime/Virtual Machine**

Short answer: **both**. Because Red is implemented to be a cross-compiler, you can create applications that can be supported by any platform able to Red, using the Red Compiler or any supported OS you prefer (Produce Android and Mac apps for a windows machine, doing the reverse, or any other scenario). In fact, it is a cross-compiler language working with a native language.

## **Supported platforms**

* Red cross-compilation targets:
* MS-DOS: Windows x86.
* Windows: Windows x86, GUI apps.
* Linux: Linux x86.
* MacOS.
* Etc.

## **Notable users**
There is not a notable specific user by Red. But you can find important platforms that have supported in Red development, such as: Microsoft, Linux, Programming Community, etc.

## **History**

Red was presented in 2011 by Nenad Rakočević. His most recent version is 0.6.4, Released in December of last year (2021).

## **Active or dead language**
According to the official page of this website, it is thought to keep improving and releasing version, therefore, it is an **active** language nowadays.
